This trend is driven by the consumer priority for functionality and performance. Notably, 67% of consumers globally prefer makeup products with added skincare benefits.

Approximately 45% of consumers globally use only 1\u20133 makeup products in their daily routines, driven by the desire to simplify and manage makeup expenses. This has led to an 11% growth in multifunctional products that combine various benefits, such as SPF protection and skincare properties.

Some 78% of these younger consumers consider packaging an important factor when purchasing makeup. This trend is characterized by a preference for products that are cruelty-free, sustainably packaged, recyclable, and available in limited editions. Brands are responding by emphasizing their commitment to the environment through ethical packaging designs.
