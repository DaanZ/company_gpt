**Insight 1: The Impact of Beauty Cyberbullying**  
Beauty Cyberbullying is a significant issue affecting millions globally, particularly young women. The partnership between The Cybersmile Foundation and Rimmel aims to address this pervasive problem, which has been linked to severe mental health issues such as self-harm, substance abuse, and eating disorders. A survey conducted by Rimmel highlighted that approximately 115 million images are removed from the internet each year due to negative comments, underscoring the scale of the problem. This alarming trend creates an environment where individuals feel discouraged from expressing their beauty and individuality, leading to a detrimental impact on their self-esteem and mental well-being.

**Insight 2: The Role of Technology in Providing Support**  
The collaboration between The Cybersmile Foundation and Rimmel will introduce an innovative AI-driven tool called 'Cybersmile Assistant,' set to launch in January 2019. This virtual assistant will serve as a resource for individuals affected by Beauty Cyberbullying, directing them to appropriate local support services, helplines, and expert articles. By leveraging technology, the initiative aims to provide immediate assistance to those in need, eliminating wait times for support and ensuring that individuals can access help as soon as they require it. This proactive approach highlights the potential of technology to empower victims and foster resilience against online abuse.

**Insight 3: Commitment to Long-Term Change**  
The three-year partnership between The Cybersmile Foundation and Rimmel signifies a long-term commitment to combating Beauty Cyberbullying and promoting a more inclusive digital environment. Both organizations recognize the urgent need for awareness and support in addressing the challenges posed by online abuse. The launch of the Beauty Cyberbullying Toolkit, which offers guidance on protecting oneself and supporting others, further emphasizes their dedication to creating a safer online space. By collaborating with influencers and celebrities, the initiative aims to raise awareness and inspire a cultural shift towards acceptance and self-expression, ultimately striving to change and save lives worldwide.
