The text highlights the profound impact of colorism on the self-perception of dark-skinned individuals. The author recounts personal experiences of being subjected to derogatory comments and jokes about their skin tone, which have led to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. This societal bias against darker skin is not just a superficial issue; it deeply affects the mental health and self-worth of those targeted.

The author encourages dark-skinned individuals to embrace their beauty and recognize their worth, regardless of societal perceptions. By learning to stand up for themselves and respond assertively to derogatory remarks, individuals can reclaim their narrative and foster a sense of pride in their identity. The text serves as a reminder that self-acceptance is crucial in combating the negative stereotypes associated with darker skin, and that individuals should not allow others to define their self-worth based on superficial attributes.

**Insight 3: The Role of Community and Representation**  
The text underscores the importance of community support and representation for dark-skinned individuals, particularly in media and beauty industries. The author notes the scarcity of dark-skinned role models in mainstream media, which can perpetuate feelings of invisibility and unworthiness among those who identify with that skin tone. By sharing their experiences and creating content that celebrates dark skin, the author aims to inspire others and foster a sense of belonging within the community. This representation is vital for challenging societal norms and encouraging individuals to embrace their unique beauty, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and diverse understanding of attractiveness.
