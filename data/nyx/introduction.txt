Notes

The Beauty-for-All Movement: What's trending in cosmetics?

Makeup also saw considerable growth, with consumers focusing more on products for specific facial areas such as lipsticks and foundation rather than sets and pale
ttes. This trend reflects consumers' desire to customize their looks and express their identities. Over half (58%) of makeup consumers use makeup to feel confident, and at least 1 in 5 use it for self-expression and experimentation. Gen Z is significantly more likely to view makeup as a way to showcase their identity.

Some key Thematics:

1. Skin Tone Representation
70% of Black women believe that beauty brands don’t cater to their skin tone .
Before the launch of Fenty Beauty in 2017, 25% of beauty brands offered foundations for dark skin tones. After Fenty's release, that number rose to 60%, showing the direct impact of inclusive product offerings .
A survey by the Skin of Color Society found that 80% of dermatologists in the U.S. reported being inadequately trained to treat skin issues in people with darker skin .
2. Body Size and Inclusivity
A study by Refinery29 and Getty Images showed that in the fashion and beauty industry, 67% of people agree that brands still promote one body type as the "ideal"—most often thin and Eurocentric .
Only 2% of models in fashion campaigns in 2022 were plus-sized, despite 67% of U.S. women wearing a size 14 or higher .
A survey by Dove revealed that 90% of women do not feel represented by images they see in the beauty industry, with over 70% of women wanting to see models of different shapes, sizes, and ethnicities .
3. Gender Inclusivity
According to a 2019 Mintel report, over 30% of Gen Z consumers prefer to shop for beauty products marketed as gender-neutral .
An increasing number of consumers, especially younger generations, are rejecting traditional gender norms, with 56% of Gen Z reporting they know someone who uses gender-neutral pronouns .
4. Natural Hair Discrimination

Over 80% of Black women feel they have to change their hair to fit into societal beauty standards, particularly in professional settings .
In the U.S., 20% of Black women between the ages of 25 and 34 have been discriminated against in the workplace because of their hair .
5. Disability Representation
15% of the global population lives with some form of disability, yet people with disabilities are largely invisible in beauty campaigns. A 2020 study revealed that people with disabilities make up less than 1% of models used in advertising across all industries .
A report by Adaptive Fashion found that 75% of people with disabilities believe fashion and beauty brands don’t design with them in mind .
6. Age Inclusivity
The global anti-aging market is valued at over $60 billion as of 2023, reflecting the intense pressure people feel to remain youthful .
Despite this, 94% of older women say they feel underrepresented in beauty ads, according to a study by AARP .
Only 12% of beauty ads feature women over the age of 50, even though women aged 50+ control 70% of disposable income in the U.S. .
7. Cultural Representation
A 2018 survey by Allure magazine found that 63% of people of color feel underrepresented in the beauty industry .
In terms of cultural appropriation, 61% of Indigenous people surveyed stated they had witnessed cultural misrepresentation in beauty or fashion, leading to feelings of erasure .
8. Consumer Preferences for Inclusivity
83% of Gen Z and Millennial consumers prefer brands that are committed to diversity and inclusion in their products and advertising .
A 2020 McKinsey study found that 45% of consumers are more likely to trust and support brands that showcase diversity in their advertising campaigns .
9. Social Injustices Resulting from Identity Bias:
Fatal Violence Against the Transgender and Gender-Expansive Community
84% of victims were people of color
50% were Black transgender women
50% were misgendered or deadnamed by authorities or the press
Murders of trans people nearly doubled over past 4 years, and Black trans women are most at risk, report finds
"Bias-motivated crimes are a real, frightening problem in the United States, and LGBTQ+ people continue to be targeted because of who they are," the Everytown report said.
This violence is not evenly spread throughout the US—44% of homicides of transgender and gender-expansive people occurred in the South.
34% of gun homicides of transgender and gender expansive people remain unsolved.
This violence disproportionately impacts young people— 57% of victims were under the age of 30.

10. Beauty bias:
Beauty bias refers to the favorable treatment and positive stereotyping of individuals who are considered more attractive. This has also given rise to the term “lookism,” or “pretty privilege”  which is discrimination based on physical appearance.
An example of beauty bias is a hiring manager who is more inclined to hire candidates they think are good-looking.
There has also historically been beauty bias in the workplace due to makeup. Women who wore makeup to the workplace are typically considered to be more “presentable” and even “professional”.
Hiring decisions should be based on skills, experience, and culture fit rather than physical appearance. This only applies to women and unfavorably favors hyper-femininity.

Gen Z’s Beauty Standard
●
Social media flourished in 2010 as millennials shared “formal content,” showcasing only their
best moments and establishing the "perfection" aesthetic. In contrast, Gen Z is redefining
beauty standards through “curated imperfection,” valuing authenticity and individuality with
photo dumps, no-makeup selfies, and candid moments. However, they still grapple with
unrealistic beauty ideals shaped by celebrities and AI-generated imagery. This creates a
complex landscape where, despite advocating for inclusivity and genuine representation, Gen Z
navigates the pressure to conform to unattainable standards while promoting a more relatable
and authentic beauty ideal.
●
Authentic Beauty Ideals
○
Freedom of expression and social causes have driven trends
○
No single definition of beauty, but vocalize freedom to be your authentic self
●
Pressure to Conform
○
Gen Z struggles to assert their individuality vs. keep up with major trends
○
Are beauty standards disguised as self-love??

MAKEUP
Historical Shortcomings in Diversity Within the Makeup Industry
The Cultural Relevance of Makeup In
America
●
During the late 1800s many many white makeup store owners
refused to consider stocking African American beauty products
●
During the 1920s, the increasing ethnic diversity in the U.S.
shaped how cosmetics companies marketed their products,
using "exotic" stereotypes to inspire makeup trends that
reflected a diverse culture.
●
While white women could adopt and discard these trendy
identities, African American identity was often excluded from this portrayal.
●
In the late 1960s, major cosmetics firms began catering to the African American
market under pressure from women of color, creating products for black women and
hiring black sales agents. However, the "ethnic" segment still represented just 2.3%
of total sales by 1977.

IDENTITY BIAS & DISCRIMINATION
Stop Only Casting “Racially Ambiguous” Models
Colorism in the Beauty Industry
●
The focus on racially ambiguous and ethnically neutral models emerged in the early 2000s. As demographics in the U.S.
began to shift, brands wanted to resonate with multicultural audiences — without alienating their general-market (a.k.a.
white) audiences. Many brands, including Louis Vuitton, YSL Beauty, and H&M stores, intentionally focused on featuring
models with racially indeterminate features, who were lighter skinned and perceived as less ethnic. What’s seen as desirable
and appealing is a model who is neutral and not “too dark.”
●
“Lots of foundations and skin-based products for black and brown people often have names of food. There is something
really dehumanising about calling [products] chocolate, caramel, mocha and coffee while all the lighter shades are porcelain
or ivory, so even within the language we are using for makeup there is that inequality. Why are we food?”
●
“I’ve heard about content creators from the BIPOC community who have been paid significantly less than their Caucasian
counterparts, which is an example of colorism in the industry. And brands with shade ranges that only work for lighter skin
tones is also a form of colorism. In 2022, that should not be acceptable for any brand — big or small.” – Ilekkiya Suppiah
●
Colorism is driving women of color to use harmful skin lightening products, says new study.
●
Organizations working to combat colorism:

https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ilekkiya-suppiah-colorism-beauty-industry
"The way in which our identities are incessantly swept under the umbrella term of ‘exotic’
demonstrates how, to certain individuals, ethnic minorities are indistinguishable from one another"
“Exotic” Beauty as a Microaggression
●
“While a white woman’s appearance is multifaceted and
adaptable, a woman of colour is reduced to her racial
origins, appearing as nothing but the colour of her skin.”
●
 “For ethnic minorities, groups that already experience a
constant sense of feeling unwelcome in the Western
cultural landscape, it is crucial that even the seemingly
smallest cases of marginalisation be terminated. Only
then can we actively work towards attaining racial
equality.”
https://www.varsity.co.uk/features/21924
Discrimination
Women of color spent nine times more on beauty products and
services than their lighter-skinned counterparts. And this has to
do with having to purchase more products to achieve
color-matching– DIY addressing the diversity deficit.
Discrimination and Harassment in Beauty Retail Operations
Companies are increasingly expected to not just respect but
promote diversity, equity, and inclusion within operations and
across their value chain. This is especially true for retail
operations, where Black, Indigenous, and Persons of Color
(BIPOC) have reported negative and discriminatory in-person
shopping experiences.
BIPOC shoppers often face humiliating, degrading experiences,
especially when confronted by security, where they can be
perceived “as a threat” by store associates.

https://www.bsr.org/en/primers/human-rights-priorities-for-beauty-and-personal-care-sector
Golloria condemned the foundation for being “minstrel-show
black”, equivalent to the exaggerated jet-black face paint used to
perform blackface.
The foundation had no undertones present – the product only had
one base color, an all-black pigment, whereas the other (lighter)
shades of foundation have a mix of at least three pigments to
represent the different undertones that human skin has.
Price Discrimination
●
Brands like Fenty Beauty, M.A.C, and Make Up
Forever offer highly rated products for darker
skin tones, though they tend to be expensive
●
Makeup users want affordable products that
match their skin tones. They believe these
options are abundant for lighter skin tones but
scarce for people of color (POC).
●
The high cost of gender-affirming makeup,
combined with barriers like harassment,
discrimination, and prohibitive expenses, limits
access to these essential products.
○
For example Amelia, a transgender women
who navigated out of homelessness, often
found herself making decisions like “should
I eat or buy gender affirming beauty
essentials?”
Makeup in the Workplace
●
Company policy at a bar in Reno to meet
with image consultants and wear makeup
(foundation, mascara, blush, etc.)
○
Poses as a financial and economic
burden
●
“The inescapable message is that
women’s undoctored faces compare
unfavorably to men’s, not because of a
physical difference between men’s and
women’s faces, but because of a cultural
assumption—and gender-based
stereotype—that women’s faces are
incomplete, unattractive, or unprofessional
without full makeup.”
Darlene Jespersen, an employee of
Reno, lost her lawsuit against her
employer.

Reclaiming Femininity Through Makeup
Makeup serves as a transformative tool for individuals reclaiming their
hyper-feminine identities, as seen in drag culture, social media influencers,
and inclusive beauty campaigns that highlight diverse aesthetics. By
sharing personal stories and participating in community events, people
confidently challenge traditional norms and celebrate their femininity.
Is there a real need to address the problem?
REAL NEED
What are the “real life” consequences of being your true, authentic self in the real world… Gen Z is best
known for our digital expression but that does not always translate in daily life. How safe is society? How can
makeup be a weapon against “bullying”? How can makeup as a “tool to color outside the lines” empower,
protect, & amplify the voices of the marginalized?
