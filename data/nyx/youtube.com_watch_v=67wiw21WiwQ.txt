The first important insight from the text is the introduction of the Cyber Smile Assistant, a resource designed to combat beauty cyberbullying. This tool aims to provide support and guidance for individuals who are facing online harassment related to their appearance. By offering helpful resources and a helpline, the Cyber Smile Assistant seeks to empower victims and create a safer online environment, highlighting the growing recognition of the need for mental health support in the digital age.

Another key insight is the emphasis on the global reach of the Cyber Smile Assistant, as it is set to launch in all English-speaking countries in 2019. This indicates a proactive approach to addressing beauty cyberbullying on an international scale, acknowledging that this issue transcends geographical boundaries. By making resources accessible to a wider audience, the initiative aims to foster a sense of community and solidarity among those affected, encouraging individuals to seek help and share their experiences.

Lastly, the repeated phrase "I will not be deleted" serves as a powerful affirmation of resilience and defiance against cyberbullying. This mantra underscores the importance of self-empowerment and the refusal to be silenced or diminished by negative online interactions. It reflects a broader movement towards promoting self-acceptance and mental well-being, encouraging individuals to stand firm in their identity and reject the harmful narratives perpetuated by cyberbullies. This message of strength is crucial in fostering a culture of support and resilience among those affected by online harassment.
