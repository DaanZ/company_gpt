 SS 25 CULTURAL SENTIMENTS | MAIN 
 
Every season, we identify key Cultural Sentiments to help clients understand what consumers are feeling and why. Not only do these Sentiments 
delve into emotions and behaviors to gauge the wider cultural climate, they provide the first step in understanding your customer and creating 
product that matters. In this report, we explore eight Cultural Sentiments, tracing where they came from, how they are manifesting in culture, and the 
opportunities they present across all markets.
