**Insight 1: The Impact of AI-Generated Content on Beauty Standards**  
The proliferation of AI-generated images in the beauty industry has created a distorted perception of beauty, making it increasingly difficult for individuals, particularly women and girls, to discern what is real. Dove's "Keep Beauty Real" campaign highlights this issue by contrasting AI-generated representations of beauty with images of real women, emphasizing the harmful effects of unrealistic beauty standards. A global beauty study reveals that 90% of women and girls have encountered harmful beauty content online, and one-third feel pressured to alter their appearance due to these unrealistic portrayals, even when they recognize them as fake. This underscores the urgent need for awareness and action against the normalization of AI-generated beauty standards.

**Insight 2: The Psychological Effects on Young People**  
The influence of altered images on social media can have severe psychological repercussions, particularly for teenagers. Parents express concern that exposure to AI-generated and heavily edited images contributes to issues such as body dysmorphia and eating disorders, as seen in the case of a mother whose daughter developed anorexia. The pressure to conform to unattainable beauty ideals can lead young individuals to engage in harmful behaviors in pursuit of a beauty that does not exist. This highlights the critical need for clearer labeling of AI-generated content on platforms like TikTok to mitigate the subconscious impact these images have on young minds.

**Insight 3: Legislative Action and Industry Responsibility**  
In response to the growing concerns surrounding AI-generated content, lawmakers are considering bipartisan legislation that would mandate the labeling of online images and videos. Currently, there are no regulations governing the use of AI in advertising and media, which raises ethical questions about the responsibility of brands and platforms in promoting realistic beauty standards. While some companies, like Dove, are pledging to avoid AI-generated imagery, others are capitalizing on the cost-saving benefits of this technology. The potential for legislative action represents a crucial step toward accountability in the beauty industry, ensuring that consumers are informed about the authenticity of the content they encounter online.
