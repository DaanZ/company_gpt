**Insight 1: Evolution of Makeup as Self-Expression**  
The perception of makeup has significantly transformed over the years, shifting from a tool primarily used by women to conceal imperfections and adhere to Eurocentric beauty standards, to an art form that celebrates individual self-expression. This evolution reflects a broader cultural shift towards embracing diverse identities and personal aesthetics. The event ‘Makeup on My Mind’ exemplifies this change, as it encourages participants to explore makeup as a means of expressing their authentic selves, regardless of gender norms. This newfound understanding of makeup allows individuals to redefine beauty on their own terms, fostering a sense of empowerment and creativity.

**Insight 2: Importance of Inclusivity in Makeup Spaces**  
Eve’s event highlights the critical need for inclusive spaces where individuals from the queer community can freely express themselves through makeup. The warm and welcoming atmosphere created at the Queer-Trans Wellness and Support Centre allowed attendees to feel safe and supported while experimenting with their looks. By providing a platform for participants to learn and practice makeup techniques, the event not only demystified the art of makeup but also reinforced the idea that everyone, regardless of gender identity, should have access to tools and knowledge that enable them to express their true selves. This inclusivity is essential for fostering a sense of belonging and community among marginalized groups.

**Insight 3: Makeup as a Tool for Gender Exploration**  
Makeup serves as a powerful medium for exploring and expressing gender identity, challenging societal norms that dictate rigid definitions of masculinity and femininity. Eve emphasizes that makeup allows individuals to creatively navigate their gender expression, breaking free from traditional expectations. Participants, like Aditya, articulate that gender should not be confined to societal standards but rather seen as a canvas for personal creativity. This perspective encourages individuals to embrace their unique identities and use makeup as a form of rebellion against conventional gender roles, ultimately promoting a more fluid understanding of gender in society.
