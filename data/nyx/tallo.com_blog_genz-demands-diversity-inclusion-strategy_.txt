Generation Z exhibits a significant fear of discrimination in both educational and workplace settings. According to the survey, 32% of respondents have refrained from applying for a job due to concerns about unfair treatment based on their gender, ethnic, or racial identity. Similarly, 25% expressed the same apprehension regarding college applications. This fear is not unfounded, as it stems from personal experiences and observations of discrimination in their environments, highlighting the urgent need for organizations to address these concerns and foster a more inclusive atmosphere.

**Insight 2: Witnessing and Experiencing Discrimination**  
The prevalence of discrimination among Gen Z is alarming, with 67% of those who have held jobs witnessing discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation. Furthermore, 44% reported feeling personally discriminated against in the workplace. The situation is even more pronounced in educational settings, where 77% of respondents have witnessed discrimination, and 51% have experienced it firsthand. These statistics underscore the critical importance of implementing effective diversity and inclusion strategies to combat discrimination and create safer, more equitable environments for all individuals.

**Insight 3: Importance of Gender Identity in Diversity and Inclusion**  
For Gen Z, diversity and inclusion extend beyond racial and ethnic identities to encompass gender identity and expression. A striking 88% of respondents believe it is essential for recruiters and employers to inquire about preferred gender pronouns, yet only 18% have had such conversations with recruiters. This gap indicates a significant area for improvement in recruitment practices. Moreover, the potential consequences of failing to respect preferred pronouns are serious, as 25% of respondents would decline a job offer if their pronouns were not acknowledged. This insight emphasizes the necessity for organizations to prioritize gender inclusivity in their diversity strategies to attract and retain Gen Z talent.
