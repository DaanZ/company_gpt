The term "exotic" is often used to describe women of color in a way that reduces their identity to their racial origins, which can be seen as a microaggression. This label implies a sense of otherness and abnormality, suggesting that individuals who do not conform to Eurocentric beauty standards are somehow inferior or different. The author reflects on personal experiences where being called "exotic" felt more like a derogatory categorization than a compliment, highlighting the dehumanizing effect of such labels when applied to people rather than objects or places.

The concept of "white fragility" plays a significant role in the perpetuation of microaggressions like the use of the term "exotic." Many individuals who use this term often do so with the intention of complimenting, yet they may become defensive or dismissive when confronted with the negative implications of their words. This defensiveness prevents meaningful conversations about race and discrimination, as it prioritizes the comfort of the person using the term over the feelings of those who are affected by it. The author emphasizes that regardless of intent, the emotional impact on the recipient should be acknowledged and respected.

Lastly, the article underscores the importance of recognizing and dismantling the colonial mindset that underlies the use of terms like "exotic." The author argues that such language reflects a sense of ownership and superiority over ethnic minorities, perpetuating a cycle of fetishization and marginalization. While some women of color may embrace the term as a form of praise, the author contends that the repeated association of beauty with race can be damaging and reductive. To achieve racial equality, it is crucial to challenge even the smallest instances of microaggressions and to foster a more inclusive understanding of beauty that transcends racial and ethnic boundaries.
