**Insight 1: Evolution of No-Makeup Makeup**  
The concept of "no-makeup makeup" has evolved significantly over the years, transitioning from a trend that involved multiple products and techniques to a more radical approach where makeup is virtually eliminated. Initially popularized by brands like Glossier and Ilia, the trend emphasized light, barely-there makeup that aimed to enhance natural beauty. However, as the beauty landscape has shifted, particularly with the rise of social media platforms like TikTok, many are now embracing a completely bare-faced look, as seen in recent fashion shows. This shift reflects a growing desire for authenticity and simplicity in beauty routines, moving away from the elaborate application processes that once defined the trend.

**Insight 2: The Glass Skin Trend**  
At the recent Prabal Gurung spring/summer 2025 show, models showcased a fresh, bare-faced look that emphasized the "glass skin" aesthetic, which focuses on achieving a luminous, healthy complexion without traditional makeup. This approach highlights the importance of skincare over makeup, with products designed to enhance the skin's natural glow rather than cover it up. The lead makeup artist, Sil Bruinsma, aimed to create a look that exuded "freshness and pureness," showcasing the versatility of the glass skin trend for all skin types and tones. This shift towards prioritizing skin health and luminosity over makeup application signifies a broader movement in the beauty industry towards embracing natural beauty.

**Insight 3: Embracing Natural Skin Textures**  
The Prabal Gurung show also emphasized the acceptance of natural skin textures, including imperfections like breakouts and fine lines, rather than striving for a flawless appearance. Models were encouraged to embrace their unique skin characteristics, enhancing their natural beauty with hydrating skincare products instead of concealing them with heavy makeup. This approach not only promotes a more realistic and relatable beauty standard but also encourages individuals to focus on skincare as a means of achieving confidence and self-acceptance. By celebrating diverse skin types and textures, the beauty industry is moving towards a more inclusive and empowering narrative that values authenticity over perfection.
