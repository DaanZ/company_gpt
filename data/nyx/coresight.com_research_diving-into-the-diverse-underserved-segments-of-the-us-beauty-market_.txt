**Insight 1: Market Growth and Inclusivity**  
The US beauty market has reached a significant scale, totaling $71.5 billion in 2022, with a year-over-year growth rate of 6.1%. This growth presents a substantial opportunity for beauty brands to capitalize on the current trend of inclusivity, as the market is increasingly recognizing the diverse needs of consumers. With nearly half of the US population identifying as non-white or multiracial, beauty companies are urged to develop products and marketing strategies that cater to these underserved segments. By aligning their offerings with the values and demands of diverse consumers, brands can enhance customer loyalty and tap into a growing market that is eager for representation and tailored products.

**Insight 2: The Importance of Segmentation**  
Coresight Research identifies five key underserved segments within the beauty market: non-white and multiracial beauty shoppers, Gen-Z beauty shoppers, male beauty shoppers, women aged 50+, and adaptive beauty shoppers. Each of these segments has unique needs and preferences that brands must understand to effectively engage them. For instance, non-white beauty shoppers prioritize a sense of belonging and personal relevance in products, while Gen-Z consumers are driven by social causes and value-driven attributes. By employing segmentation and personalization strategies, beauty brands can create targeted communications and product offerings that resonate with these diverse groups, ultimately fostering stronger customer relationships and increasing market share.

**Insight 3: Evolving Consumer Behavior**  
Consumer behavior in the beauty market is evolving, particularly among younger demographics and male shoppers. Gen-Z beauty shoppers, who are the most diverse demographic group, are increasingly influencing market trends with their spending habits and values, such as environmental sustainability and inclusivity. Additionally, male beauty shoppers are breaking traditional norms, showing a growing interest in cosmetics and self-care products. This shift indicates a broader acceptance of beauty products across genders and age groups, suggesting that brands must adapt their marketing strategies and product lines to meet the changing preferences of these consumers. By recognizing and responding to these evolving behaviors, beauty companies can position themselves for long-term success in a competitive landscape.
