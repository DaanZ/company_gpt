The brand's marketing features a diverse range of models, including individuals of various skin tones, genders, and backgrounds, which resonates deeply with consumers who have historically been overlooked by mainstream skincare brands. This approach not only makes the products more appealing to a broader audience but also fosters a sense of belonging and visibility for marginalized groups. By showcasing a variety of identities, Fenty Skin challenges the traditional norms of beauty advertising and sets a new standard for inclusivity in the industry.

The brand launched with three multitasking products that combine essential skincare functions, such as a cleanser that also removes makeup and a moisturizer that includes SPF. This design philosophy caters to the modern consumer's desire for simplicity and efficiency in their skincare routines. Rihanna's personal experiences with skincare influenced the development of these products, as she aimed to create solutions that are approachable and easy to use for everyone, regardless of their skincare knowledge or background.
