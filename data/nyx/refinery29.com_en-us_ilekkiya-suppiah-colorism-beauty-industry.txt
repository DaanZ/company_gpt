**Insight 1: The Impact of Colorism on Beauty Standards**  
Ilekkiya Suppiah highlights the pervasive issue of colorism, which is the prejudice against individuals with darker skin tones. She shares personal experiences of being subjected to derogatory comments and feeling excluded from beauty standards that favor lighter skin. This societal bias not only affects self-esteem but also influences the availability of beauty products that cater to diverse skin tones. Suppiah's journey illustrates how colorism is deeply rooted in Eurocentric beauty ideals, leading to a lack of representation and inclusivity in the beauty industry.

**Insight 2: The Importance of Representation in the Beauty Industry**  
Suppiah emphasizes the significance of representation for people of color in the beauty space. She recounts her struggles to find makeup products that matched her skin tone and the frustration of seeing beauty looks that did not cater to darker skin. By becoming a content creator, she aims to fill the gap in representation and provide guidance to others who share similar experiences. The positive feedback she receives from her audience underscores the need for visibility and the impact it can have on boosting confidence among individuals who have been marginalized in the beauty narrative.

**Insight 3: The Need for Genuine Inclusivity in Beauty Brands**  
While acknowledging some progress in the beauty industry, such as the launch of inclusive brands like Fenty Beauty, Suppiah argues that true inclusivity goes beyond just offering a range of shades. She stresses that brands must also employ people from the BIPOC community to ensure that their products and marketing strategies genuinely reflect the diversity of their consumers. Suppiah points out that simply featuring diverse models or expanding shade ranges is insufficient if the decision-makers within these companies do not represent the communities they aim to serve. This call for systemic change highlights the ongoing challenges of achieving equity in the beauty industry.
