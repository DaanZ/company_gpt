**Insight 1: State-Level Regulations on Cosmetics**  
In the absence of comprehensive federal oversight, several states have taken the initiative to regulate cosmetic safety, leading to the enactment of various laws aimed at protecting consumers. For instance, California has implemented multiple legislative measures, such as the Safe Cosmetics Act, which mandates the disclosure of products containing Proposition 65 chemicals known to cause cancer or reproductive harm. Additionally, the CA Toxic-Free Cosmetics Act bans 24 toxic chemicals from cosmetics sold in the state, including formaldehyde and certain parabens, with the aim of aligning with stricter regulations already in place in the European Union. These state-level actions reflect a growing recognition of the need for safer cosmetic products and greater transparency regarding harmful ingredients.

**Insight 2: Federal Legislative Efforts and Limitations**  
The Modernization of Cosmetic Regulations Act (MoCRA), signed into law in 2022, represents a significant step toward improving cosmetic safety at the federal level. It introduces essential reforms, such as requiring FDA registration of cosmetic products and facilities, establishing good manufacturing practices, and mandating adverse event reporting. However, despite these advancements, MoCRA has notable limitations, including a weak safety standard that does not empower the FDA to audit companies or verify the safety of cosmetic ingredients before they reach consumers. Furthermore, the law includes provisions for federal preemption, which restricts states from enacting their own cosmetic safety regulations, potentially hindering local efforts to protect public health.

**Insight 3: International Standards and Comparisons**  
Internationally, cosmetic regulations in Canada and the European Union are significantly more stringent than those in the United States, reflecting a precautionary approach to chemical safety. Canada requires manufacturers to notify Health Canada about cosmetic products and disclose all ingredients, while the EU has banned 1,693 chemicals linked to serious health risks, including cancer and reproductive harm. The EU's regulatory framework mandates pre-market safety assessments and prohibits animal testing for cosmetics, showcasing a commitment to consumer safety that contrasts sharply with the U.S. system, which has only banned a handful of chemicals. This disparity highlights the need for the U.S. to adopt more rigorous safety standards to protect consumers from harmful substances in cosmetics.
