### What is the cultural significance/role of makeup?
Makeup has long been a form of self-expression, creativity, and identity. Culturally, it serves various purposes, from enhancing beauty to conveying social status, cultural heritage, and personal beliefs. In many societies, makeup is used to signify rites of passage, celebrate cultural traditions, or even as a form of art. It allows individuals to express their personality, mood, and creativity, making it a powerful tool for self-identity.

### How historically/culturally/symbolically has makeup been used and what‚Äôs its role/how is it used today?
Historically, makeup has been used in various cultures for thousands of years. For example:

- Ancient Egypt: Both men and women used kohl to line their eyes, not only for aesthetic purposes but also for protection against the sun and to ward off evil spirits.
- Geisha Culture in Japan: Geishas use makeup as a form of art, with specific styles and colors representing different aspects of their identity and profession.
- Indigenous Cultures: Many Indigenous peoples use makeup and body paint in ceremonies to connect with their heritage and express cultural identity.
Today, makeup continues to evolve, with modern trends emphasizing individuality and inclusivity. It is used not just for beauty enhancement but also as a means of empowerment, allowing individuals to challenge societal norms and express their unique identities.

### How is makeup being used to advance the DEI movement?
Makeup brands are increasingly recognizing their role in promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Many brands are expanding their product lines to cater to a wider range of skin tones and types, ensuring that everyone can find products that suit their needs. For instance, Fenty Beauty‚Äôs launch of 40 foundation shades set a new standard for inclusivity in the beauty industry.

Additionally, brands are using their platforms to advocate for social justice, support marginalized communities, and challenge beauty standards that have historically excluded certain groups. Campaigns that feature diverse models and promote body positivity are becoming more common, helping to foster a more inclusive beauty landscape.

### What value/relationship do marginalized or discriminated against groups see with makeup and what is its primary role?
For marginalized or discriminated against groups, makeup can serve as a powerful tool for self-empowerment and expression. It allows individuals to reclaim their identities, challenge stereotypes, and assert their presence in a society that may not always recognize or celebrate their beauty. Makeup can also provide a sense of community, as individuals share tips, techniques, and experiences that resonate with their unique journeys.

The primary role of makeup for these groups often extends beyond aesthetics; it becomes a means of self-affirmation and a way to navigate societal expectations. By embracing makeup, individuals can express their creativity, challenge conventional beauty norms, and celebrate their identities in a world that is increasingly recognizing the importance of diversity and inclusion.

In summary, makeup holds significant cultural value and plays a vital role in self-expression, empowerment, and the advancement of DEI initiatives. It is a dynamic tool that continues to evolve, reflecting the diverse identities and experiences of individuals across the globe.
