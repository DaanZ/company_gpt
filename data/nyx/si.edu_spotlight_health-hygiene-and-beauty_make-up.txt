**Insight 1: Evolution of Cosmetic Use in American Society**  
The use of cosmetics in America has undergone significant transformations, particularly in the context of gender and social acceptance. In the 18th century, both men and women of the upper classes utilized makeup, but post-American Revolution, visible cosmetics became socially unacceptable, especially for women. Throughout the 19th century, women resorted to homemade recipes for beauty products, as the use of "paint" was associated with vulgarity and prostitution. This shift reflects broader societal attitudes towards femininity and the ideal of a "natural" appearance, which women strived to achieve through discreet beauty practices.

**Insight 2: The Rise of the Cosmetics Industry and Women's Empowerment**  
The late 19th and early 20th centuries marked the emergence of the cosmetics industry, with entrepreneurs, including many women, creating products that promised a natural look. This period saw the establishment of business models that allowed women to earn independent incomes, such as the agent system pioneered by companies like Avon. The cosmetics trade provided opportunities for women from humble backgrounds to build successful businesses, highlighting a significant shift in women's roles in the workforce and their growing economic independence. However, African American women faced additional challenges in gaining recognition and market access within the beauty industry.

**Insight 3: Cultural Shifts and Political Dimensions of Makeup**  
The cultural significance of makeup evolved dramatically through the 20th century, particularly during and after World War II. As women entered the workforce in large numbers, cosmetics became a symbol of femininity and empowerment, with advertisements promoting the idea that makeup was essential for maintaining one's identity as a woman. The post-war era saw a surge in lipstick usage, with companies like Avon and Revlon capitalizing on this trend. However, the late 1960s introduced a counter-cultural movement that questioned traditional beauty standards, leading to a politicization of makeup. This period prompted cosmetics companies to adapt their marketing strategies to include products for women of color, although the market for these products remained limited, reflecting ongoing racial dynamics within the beauty industry.
