The text emphasizes the importance of recognizing colorism as a systemic issue within the marketing industry. Colorism, defined as discrimination against individuals with darker skin tones, is deeply rooted in societal biases that favor lighter skin. This acknowledgment is crucial for marketers aiming to connect authentically with Black and brown communities. By understanding the historical context and ongoing implications of colorism, marketers can begin to dismantle their own biases and make more informed decisions about representation in their campaigns.

Marketers are encouraged to collaborate with agencies that prioritize diversity and inclusion, ensuring that the voices and insights of the communities they wish to serve are represented. This approach not only enhances the authenticity of marketing initiatives but also supports minority-owned businesses, fostering a more equitable industry. By diversifying their supplier base and engaging with culturally competent partners, brands can unlock new growth opportunities and better resonate with diverse audiences.

**Insight 3: Intentional Representation in Marketing Content**

It critiques the trend of using racially ambiguous models, which often leads to the exclusion of darker-skinned individuals. Marketers are urged to consciously feature dark-skinned models and ensure that product shots reflect diversity, moving away from defaulting to stock photography that lacks representation. By making these intentional choices, brands can challenge stereotypes, promote inclusivity, and align their marketing strategies with the values of today's consumers, who increasingly demand authenticity and representation from the brands they support.
