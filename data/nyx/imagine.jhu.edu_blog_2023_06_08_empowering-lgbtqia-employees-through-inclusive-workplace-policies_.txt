**Insight 1: Prevalence of Discrimination Against LGBTQIA+ Employees**  
The survey data from UCLA reveals a troubling reality for LGBTQIA+ workers, with nearly half reporting experiences of unfair treatment in their professional environments. This discrimination can take various forms, including harassment, unequal opportunities, and biased treatment based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The findings are particularly concerning for LGBTQIA+ employees of color, who are more likely to face verbal harassment and job opportunity denials. Such experiences not only affect the well-being of these employees but also hinder their career advancement, leading to feelings of frustration and isolation.

**Insight 2: Impact of Inclusivity on Talent Retention**  
A significant study by myGwork highlights the critical importance of inclusivity in the workplace, revealing that 66% of university students and graduates would consider leaving a job if they could not authentically express their LGBTQIA+ identity. This statistic underscores the necessity for organizations to foster an environment where employees feel valued and respected for who they are. The lack of inclusivity not only affects employee morale but also has detrimental effects on talent retention and overall organizational performance, making it imperative for companies to prioritize LGBTQIA+ inclusivity as a core value.

**Insight 3: Essential Inclusive Policies for Support**  
To create a supportive environment for LGBTQIA+ employees, organizations must implement inclusive workplace policies that explicitly protect individuals based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression. Key policies include non-discriminatory practices, gender-inclusive restrooms, comprehensive healthcare benefits covering gender-affirming treatments, gender-neutral dress codes, and equitable parental leave policies. These measures not only demonstrate a commitment to inclusivity but also help shape a workplace culture that values diversity and fosters acceptance, ultimately leading to a more empowered and engaged workforce.
