The Ipsos LGBT+ Pride 2021 Global Survey reveals a significant generational gap in the understanding and acceptance of diverse gender identities and sexual orientations. Among Gen Z individuals, 4% identify as transgender, non-binary, or gender-fluid, compared to just 1% of the overall adult population. This indicates a growing recognition and acceptance of non-traditional gender identities among younger generations, suggesting that societal norms around gender are evolving and becoming more inclusive.

The survey also highlights varying levels of exposure to the LGBT+ community across different countries. For instance, 66% of respondents in Brazil reported having a gay or lesbian relative, friend, or colleague, while only 7% in Japan and South Korea reported the same. This disparity underscores the influence of cultural context on the acceptance and visibility of LGBT+ individuals, indicating that societal attitudes towards LGBT+ issues can differ significantly based on geographic and cultural factors.

Furthermore, the survey indicates widespread support for anti-discrimination laws and equal rights for LGBT+ individuals in most of the 27 countries surveyed, although there are notable exceptions. Majorities in many countries favor corporate activism promoting equality and support for LGBT individuals being open about their sexual orientation or gender identity. However, public opinion remains divided on issues such as allowing transgender athletes to compete according to their identified gender, reflecting ongoing debates and challenges within the broader discourse on LGBT+ rights and inclusion.
