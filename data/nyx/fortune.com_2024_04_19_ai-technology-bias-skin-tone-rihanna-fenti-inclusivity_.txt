**Insight 1: The Fenty Effect and Inclusivity in Cosmetics**  
Rihanna's launch of Fenty Beauty in 2017 marked a significant turning point in the cosmetics industry by introducing a diverse range of 40 foundation shades, which addressed the long-standing issue of limited shade options for various skin tones. This initiative, referred to as the "Fenty effect," not only revolutionized how beauty brands approach inclusivity but also highlighted the importance of representation in product offerings. The success of Fenty Beauty has prompted other brands to expand their shade ranges and prioritize skin tone diversity, allowing consumers from different backgrounds to find products that cater to their unique needs. This shift in the cosmetics industry serves as a powerful example of how addressing inclusivity can lead to greater consumer satisfaction and market success.

**Insight 2: Bias in AI and the Need for Diverse Perspectives**  
The article discusses the hidden biases present in AI, particularly in computer vision technologies, which often rely on a narrow understanding of skin tones. Traditionally, AI developers have used the Fitzpatrick scale, which inadequately represents the full spectrum of skin tones, leading to significant biases against individuals with darker or non-Caucasian skin tones. This limited perspective not only perpetuates existing inequalities but also fails to account for the diverse experiences of various racial and ethnic groups. The introduction of a two-dimensional skin tone scale by the author's research team aims to address these biases by enabling developers to better identify and mitigate disparities in AI performance across different skin tones, emphasizing the necessity of incorporating diverse perspectives in AI development.

**Insight 3: The Consequences of AI Bias in High-Stakes Applications**  
AI bias can have serious implications, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as facial recognition technology used for law enforcement or self-driving cars. The uncertainty created by biased AI systems can lead to individuals being misidentified or unfairly treated, resulting in a sense of alienation and systemic exclusion. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into everyday life, the potential for small biases to accumulate and affect marginalized groups raises significant ethical concerns. The article underscores the urgency of addressing algorithmic discrimination, as highlighted by regulatory efforts like the EU AI Act and the Biden administration's executive order on AI. By prioritizing the identification and correction of biases in AI, developers can work towards creating more equitable technologies that do not perpetuate existing societal inequalities.
