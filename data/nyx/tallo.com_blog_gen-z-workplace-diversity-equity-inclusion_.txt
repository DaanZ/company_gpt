**Insight 1: High Expectations for DEI**  
Generation Z places a significant emphasis on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the workplace, with 99% of surveyed individuals indicating that DEI is important to them. Among these, 87% consider it very important. However, there is a notable disconnect between their expectations and the current state of American workplaces, as only 38% of Gen Zers believe that these environments are truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive. This gap highlights the urgent need for companies to actively implement and enhance their DEI strategies to meet the expectations of this generation, which is crucial for attracting and retaining future talent.

**Insight 2: Experiences of Discrimination**  
Despite increased societal focus on civil rights, the experiences of workplace discrimination among Gen Z are on the rise. In a survey conducted in 2021, 48% of respondents reported feeling discriminated against due to their race, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation, an increase from 44% in 2020. Additionally, fear of discrimination is influencing job application decisions, with 37% of Gen Zers opting not to apply to certain workplaces due to concerns about acceptance based on their identity. This trend underscores the pressing need for companies to create more inclusive environments and address discrimination proactively to foster a sense of belonging among their employees.

**Insight 3: Demand for Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)**  
Generation Z is keen on participating in Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and expects their future employers to have such initiatives in place. A significant 86% of respondents expressed interest in joining DEI-related ERGs or committees, yet many workplaces lack these resources or do not promote them effectively. Currently, only 40% of employed Gen Zers report that their workplaces have ERGs addressing DEI issues. This indicates a clear opportunity for companies to establish and promote ERGs that focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion, particularly those that support people of color and women, to engage and empower their younger workforce.
