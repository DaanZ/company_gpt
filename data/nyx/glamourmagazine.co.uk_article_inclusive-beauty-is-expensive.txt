**Insight 1: The Challenge of Finding Suitable Makeup**  
The text highlights the significant challenges faced by Black women when searching for makeup products, particularly foundations. It emphasizes that finding the right foundation involves multiple factors, including skin type, shade, and undertone, which can be particularly daunting for individuals with darker skin tones. The author points out that while some brands have made strides in offering darker shades, the overall experience in drugstores often leaves consumers feeling frustrated and underrepresented, as many brands still prioritize lighter shades in their product lines.

**Insight 2: The Impact of Fenty Beauty on the Market**  
The launch of Fenty Beauty is presented as a pivotal moment in the beauty industry, particularly for brands catering to diverse skin tones. The author notes that Fenty's extensive range of foundation shades, which includes a significant number of darker tones, has set a new standard for inclusivity in beauty. This shift has prompted other brands to reconsider their offerings and marketing strategies, as consumers have shown a strong demand for products that cater to a wider array of skin tones. The success of Fenty Beauty illustrates that there is a substantial market for well-formulated products for darker skin, challenging the notion that these shades are less profitable.

**Insight 3: The Need for Affordable Options**  
The text underscores the lack of affordable makeup options for people of color, particularly those with deep skin tones. The author expresses concern that many drugstore brands neglect this demographic, often offering only a limited selection of shades that do not meet the needs of darker-skinned consumers. This gap in the market creates a barrier for individuals who may not have the financial means to purchase higher-end brands like M.A.C or Fenty. The call for more affordable and diverse makeup options reflects a broader demand for inclusivity in the beauty industry, urging brands to recognize and cater to the needs of all consumers, regardless of their skin tone.
