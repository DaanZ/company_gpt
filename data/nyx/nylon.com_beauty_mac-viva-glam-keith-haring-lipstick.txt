**Insight 1: Historical Context and Purpose of Viva Glam**  
The MAC Viva Glam campaign was launched in 1994 during a time when HIV/AIDS was a leading cause of death among Americans aged 25 to 44. The initiative was created to address the bleakness surrounding the epidemic, with the first lipstick shade being a bright cerulean, symbolizing hope and vibrancy. The campaign promised that 100% of the proceeds would go to the MAC AIDS Fund, which has since raised over half a billion dollars to support organizations fighting HIV/AIDS. This historical context highlights the brand's commitment to social responsibility and its role in uniting the community against a common cause.

**Insight 2: Collaboration with Keith Haring**  
In 2021, MAC announced a collaboration with the late artist Keith Haring for the Viva Glam collection, marking a significant milestone in the campaign's history. Haring, who died of HIV/AIDS, is celebrated for his vibrant and iconic art that resonates with the spirit of the 1980s and 1990s. The collection features three lipsticks in bold primary colors—red, blue, and yellow—reflecting Haring's artistic style. The partnership not only pays homage to Haring's legacy but also connects the ongoing fight against HIV/AIDS with contemporary issues, emphasizing the importance of art in activism and community engagement.

**Insight 3: Ongoing Relevance and Impact of the Fund**  
The Viva Glam fund remains relevant today, especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has drawn parallels to the HIV/AIDS crisis of the past. MAC has continued its commitment to social causes by donating $10 million from the fund to support organizations that provide essential services during the pandemic. This ongoing support underscores MAC's ethos of community and giving back, positioning the brand as a proactive participant in addressing public health challenges. The Viva Glam initiative not only reflects the brand's history but also serves as a beacon of hope and resilience for future generations.
