What does beauty â€˜meanâ€™ today?

Beauty today is increasingly defined by individuality and self-expression. Itâ€™s no longer just about conforming to traditional standards; instead, it celebrates diversity in all its forms. People are embracing their unique features, and beauty is seen as a way to express one's identity, creativity, and personal style. This shift has been largely influenced by social media, where authenticity and relatability are highly valued.

### What is the beauty standard for Gen Z?

For Gen Z, beauty standards are evolving to prioritize authenticity over perfection. This generation values "curated imperfection," where natural looks, no-makeup selfies, and candid moments are celebrated. They are more likely to reject the unrealistic beauty ideals perpetuated by traditional media and instead embrace a broader definition of beauty that includes all skin tones, body types, and gender identities. Gen Z is also vocal about the importance of inclusivity and representation in the beauty industry.

### How do this generation define what beauty is and how is that changing?

Gen Z defines beauty as a reflection of individuality and self-acceptance. They are challenging the notion of a singular beauty ideal and advocating for a more inclusive approach that recognizes and celebrates differences. This change is driven by their desire for representation and the need to see themselves reflected in beauty campaigns. They are also more aware of the impact of beauty standards on mental health and are pushing for brands to promote positive body image and self-love.

### What is the â€˜uglinessâ€™ in the beauty industry and what are the inequalities and biases that perpetuate it?

The "ugliness" in the beauty industry often stems from issues like colorism, lack of representation, and unrealistic beauty standards. Many brands have historically focused on Eurocentric beauty ideals, leaving out people of color and those with diverse backgrounds. This has led to feelings of exclusion and inadequacy among marginalized groups. Additionally, biases in marketing and product offerings can perpetuate stereotypes and reinforce harmful narratives about beauty.

### Which beauty brands are taking an activist stance and what do they stand for?

Several beauty brands are taking an activist stance and advocating for social change. For example:

- Fenty Beauty: Founded by Rihanna, Fenty Beauty has revolutionized the industry with its inclusive shade range, promoting diversity and representation.
- Dove: Known for its commitment to real beauty, Dove has launched campaigns that challenge traditional beauty standards and promote body positivity.
- MAC Cosmetics: Through its Viva Glam campaign, MAC has raised millions for HIV/AIDS awareness and LGBTQ+ rights, showcasing its commitment to social causes.

### What is the role/opportunity for greater accessibility across the beauty industry?
There is a significant opportunity for greater accessibility in the beauty industry, particularly for individuals with disabilities, those from diverse backgrounds, and those seeking affordable options. Brands can focus on creating products that cater to a wider range of skin tones, types, and needs. Additionally, implementing inclusive marketing strategies and ensuring that beauty products are available at various price points can help make beauty accessible to all. By prioritizing accessibility, brands can foster a more inclusive environment that empowers everyone to express their beauty.
