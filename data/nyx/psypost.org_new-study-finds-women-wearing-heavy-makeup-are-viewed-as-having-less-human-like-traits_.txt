**Insight 1: Dehumanization Linked to Heavy Makeup**  
The study published in the journal Sex Roles reveals a concerning relationship between heavy makeup and the perception of women as possessing fewer human-like traits. Researchers found that participants rated women wearing heavy makeup as having diminished qualities such as humanness, agency, warmth, and morality compared to those without makeup. This suggests that heavy makeup can lead to a subtle form of dehumanization, where individuals are viewed more as objects of sexual appeal rather than as complete human beings with personalities and emotions.

**Insight 2: Sexualization and Perception of Makeup**  
The research indicates that makeup not only enhances the sexualization of women's faces but also influences how they are cognitively processed. The study demonstrated that faces adorned with heavy makeup were perceived as more sexualized, which aligns with previous findings that sexualized images prompt dehumanization and objectification. However, the researchers noted that the mechanism of sexualization did not directly correlate with the dehumanization observed, suggesting that the cognitive processing of heavily made-up faces may resemble that of objects rather than humans, leading to a reduction in perceived human-like traits.

**Insight 3: Need for Further Research**  
The findings of this study open the door for further exploration into the social and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the dehumanization associated with heavy makeup. The researchers emphasized the importance of replicating their findings with varying levels of makeup intensity to better understand the thresholds at which dehumanization occurs. Additionally, future studies could investigate the broader implications of these perceptions on women's social interactions and self-esteem, as well as the societal norms surrounding beauty standards and their psychological effects on both women and men.
