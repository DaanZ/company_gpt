In the past few years, many have embraced the spirit of play as a way to curb everyday boredom and ease growing anxieties. Consumers are exploring new hobbies and taking up old pastimes, like 
board games  and roller skating. They are also rediscovering childlike joy in collecting toys  and on new playgrounds thoughtfully designed for all ages. This emphasis on play marks a distinct 
cultural shift in which leisure isn’t seen as unproductive but essential to our livelihood, especially post-pandemic. Among its many benefits, play has been proven to strengthen relationships, boost 
creativity, improve brain function, and relieve stress. For this reason, elements of play are developing into important considerations on the community level, as well as across all markets and 
categories, from home to accessories. In this report, we examine some of the key cultural manifestations and opportunities within this emerging world of play.
