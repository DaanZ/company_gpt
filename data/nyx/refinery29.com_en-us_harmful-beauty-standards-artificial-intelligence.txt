**Insight 1: The Impact of AI Influencers on Beauty Standards**  
The emergence of AI influencers, such as Reem and Kenza, has raised significant concerns about the reinforcement of Western beauty standards, particularly for women of color. These AI-generated figures often embody a Westernized ideal that is unattainable for many, perpetuating a narrow definition of beauty that excludes the diverse features of people of color. This trend not only affects self-perception among individuals who do not fit these ideals but also risks erasing the unique attributes that contribute to the beauty of various cultures. The discomfort felt by individuals of color in response to these AI influencers highlights the ongoing struggle against Eurocentric beauty norms in a digital age.

**Insight 2: The Psychological Effects of AI and Filters**  
The article discusses the psychological ramifications of AI and social media filters on individuals, particularly women of color. Many people report feeling inadequate when comparing their natural appearance to the polished, idealized images presented by AI influencers and filters. This comparison can lead to a desire for cosmetic procedures and a sense of embarrassment about one's natural features. The phenomenon of facial dysmorphia is also noted, where individuals perceive minor imperfections as significant flaws due to the unrealistic standards set by digital representations. This cycle of comparison and dissatisfaction underscores the need for a more inclusive and realistic portrayal of beauty in both digital and real-world contexts.

**Insight 3: The Need for Ethical Considerations in AI Development**  
The rise of AI influencers prompts a critical examination of the ethical implications surrounding their creation and use. The article emphasizes the importance of diverse representation in AI development to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes and beauty ideals. It calls for regulations and transparency in AI-generated content, similar to existing guidelines for advertising and influencer marketing. By advocating for a more inclusive approach and holding creators accountable, there is an opportunity to reshape the narrative around beauty standards and ensure that AI technology serves to celebrate diversity rather than diminish it. The conversation around AI in beauty is not just about aesthetics; it is about fostering a culture that values authenticity and inclusivity.
