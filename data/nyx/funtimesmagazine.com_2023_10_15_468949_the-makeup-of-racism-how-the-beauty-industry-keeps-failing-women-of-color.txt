**Insight 1: Historical Exclusion in the Beauty Industry**  
The beauty industry has a long-standing history of exclusion and marginalization, particularly affecting women of color. Many individuals, like Lydia John, have experienced the frustration of searching for makeup products that match their skin tones, often finding only a limited range of shades that cater predominantly to lighter skin. This lack of representation not only highlights the industry's failure to acknowledge the diverse beauty needs of people of color but also reflects a broader societal standard of beauty that prioritizes whiteness. As a result, women of color have often been forced to compromise by mixing products or settling for shades that do not truly match their skin, underscoring the urgent need for brands to expand their offerings to be more inclusive.

**Insight 2: Economic Impact and Consumer Spending**  
Despite the beauty industry's historical neglect of women of color, there is a significant economic impact associated with this demographic. A report by Nielsen revealed that women of color spend nine times more on beauty products and services compared to their lighter-skinned counterparts, with Black consumers alone spending $1.2 trillion in the U.S. in 2020, including $473 million on beauty products. This statistic emphasizes the paradox of the beauty industry: while it profits immensely from Black consumers, it continues to overlook their specific beauty needs. The economic power of women of color in the beauty market presents an opportunity for brands to invest in inclusivity and cater to a demographic that is eager for products that reflect their unique beauty.

**Insight 3: The Shift Towards Inclusivity**  
In recent years, there has been a noticeable shift in the beauty industry towards inclusivity, driven by consumer demand and the success of brands that prioritize diverse representation. Brands like Fenty Beauty, launched by Rihanna, have set a new standard by offering a wide range of foundation shades that cater to various skin tones, including very deep shades. Other brands, such as MAC Cosmetics and Lanc√¥me, have also made strides in expanding their product lines to be more inclusive. This movement towards inclusivity not only challenges harmful stereotypes and biases but also fosters a sense of belonging among consumers. As brands continue to recognize the importance of catering to diverse beauty needs, the industry is gradually evolving to become a more equitable space for all individuals, regardless of their skin tone.
