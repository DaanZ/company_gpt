**Insight 1: Inclusivity in Foundation Shades**  
Fenty Beauty's launch marked a significant shift in the beauty industry by offering an unprecedented range of 40 foundation shades, particularly catering to women of color. This inclusivity challenged the long-standing trend where mainstream brands predominantly focused on lighter shades, often neglecting deeper skin tones. The immediate sell-out of many deeper shades upon release highlighted a previously overlooked demand, demonstrating that the market for diverse foundation options is not only viable but also profitable. This shift in focus has prompted a broader conversation about the need for inclusivity in beauty products, pushing other brands to reconsider their offerings.

**Insight 2: Historical Context of Beauty Standards**  
The beauty industry has a complex history of catering to narrow definitions of beauty, often sidelining women of color. Despite previous attempts by brands like Make Up For Ever and Covergirl to introduce more inclusive products, the industry has largely failed to meet the needs of diverse consumers. The historical context reveals that even as early as the 1940s, beauty companies prioritized skin-lightening products over those that celebrated darker skin tones. Movements like "Black is Beautiful" in the 1970s began to shift this narrative, leading to the emergence of black-owned beauty brands that catered specifically to the needs of women of color, yet mainstream brands have often lagged behind in truly embracing this inclusivity.

**Insight 3: The Role of Social Media and Independent Brands**  
Social media has revolutionized the beauty industry by providing a platform for independent brands and influencers to connect directly with consumers, particularly women of color. Unlike traditional advertising methods used by major brands, independent creators leverage social media to build intimate relationships with their audiences, often resulting in a more authentic representation of beauty. This shift has allowed brands like koyVoca and The Lip Bar to thrive by offering products that resonate with their target demographic. The success of Fenty Beauty and similar brands underscores the importance of understanding and responding to consumer demands in a more personal and inclusive manner, highlighting the potential for independent brands to fill gaps left by mainstream companies.
