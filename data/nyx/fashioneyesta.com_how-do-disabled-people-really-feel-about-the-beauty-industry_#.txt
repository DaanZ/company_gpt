**Insight 1: Lack of Accessibility in the Beauty Industry**  
The survey conducted by Fashioneyesta revealed a significant gap in accessibility within the beauty industry for disabled individuals. A staggering 95.1% of respondents felt that there were not enough inclusive or accessible beauty brands available, and 93.1% expressed that the industry did not cater to their specific needs. This highlights a critical oversight in a multi-billion dollar industry that has largely failed to accommodate the diverse requirements of disabled consumers, despite their substantial spending power, which is estimated to be around $8 trillion globally.

**Insight 2: Barriers to Online and In-Store Shopping**  
Disabled individuals face numerous barriers when shopping for beauty products, both online and in physical stores. The survey indicated that 52% of disabled respondents had been unable to purchase a beauty product due to inaccessible websites, with challenges such as finding the right shade and navigating product descriptions being particularly problematic. In-store shopping also presented difficulties, with 54.4% of respondents reporting that they could not purchase products due to physical inaccessibility, such as locating items or receiving assistance from staff. These barriers contribute to a feeling of isolation and frustration among disabled consumers, as they struggle to engage with the beauty industry.

**Insight 3: Need for Representation and Inclusive Design**  
The lack of representation of disabled individuals in the beauty industry is another significant concern, with 88.3% of survey participants feeling that there was insufficient disability representation in brand campaigns. While some brands have made strides in inclusivity, such as hiring models with disabilities and creating accessible products, many disabled individuals still feel excluded from the narrative of beauty. This lack of representation serves as a reminder of the systemic barriers faced by disabled people, emphasizing the need for brands to adopt inclusive design practices that consider the diverse experiences and needs of all consumers, ultimately fostering a more empowering and accessible beauty landscape.
