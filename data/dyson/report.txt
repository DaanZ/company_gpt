could
 
do
 
better
 
than
 
Dyson:
●
Highlight
 
the
 
health
 
benefits
 
of
 
its
 
headphones:
 
Sony's
 
headphones
 
with
 
air
 
filters
 
have
 
the
 
potential
 
to
 
provide
 
several
 
health
 
benefits,
 
such
 
as
 
filtering
 
out
 
pollutants

●
Create
 
a
 
more
 
immersive
 
brand
 
experience:

marketing
 
is
 
relatively
 
traditional.
 
Sony

augmented
 
reality
 
or
 
virtual

try
 
on
 
its

sound
 
quality
 
firsthand.
Overall,
 
Sony
 
is
 
a
 
strong
 
competitor
 
in
 
the
 
headphones
 
market.
 
The
 
company
 
has
 
a
 
strong
 
brand
 
reputation,
 
a
 
focus
 
on
 
innovation,
 
and
 
a
 
diverse
 
product
 
range.
 
However ,
 
there
 
are
 
a
 
few
 
areas
 
where

By

targeting

broader
 
audience,
 
and
 
creating
 
a
 
more

What

doing
 
well:
●
Focus
 
on
 
product
 
quality:
 
Sennheiser
 
is
 
known
 
for
 
its
 
commitment
 
to
 
producing
 
high-quality
 
headphones.
 
This
 
is
 
evident
 
in
 
their
 
use
 
of
 
premium
 
materials
 
and
 
their
 
attention
 
to
 
detail
 
in
 
design
 
and
 
engineering.
●
Brand
 
loyalty:
 
Sennheiser
 
has
 
a
 
strong
 
brand
 
reputation
 
that
 
is
 
built
 
on
 
trust
 
and
 
quality .
 
This
 
loyalty
 
has
 
helped
 
them
 
to
 
maintain
 
a
 
strong
 
presence
 
in
 
the
 
market.
●
Effective
 
marketing:
 
Sennheiser
 
uses
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
marketing
 
channels
 
to
 
reach
 
their
 
target
 
audience.
 
They
 
are
 
particularly
 
strong
 
in
 
social
 
media
 
and
 
influencer
 
marketing.
What
 
Sennheiser
 
could
 
do
 
better:
●
Increase
 
social
 
media
 
presence:
 
Sennheiser's
 
social
 
media
 
following
 
is
 
relatively
 
small.
 
By
 
increasing
 
their
 
social
 
media
 
presence,
 
they
 
can
 
connect
 
with
 
more
 
potential
 
customers
 
and
 
promote
 
their
 
products
 
more
 
effectively .
●
Leverage
 
influencer
 
marketing:
 
Sennheiser
 
could
 
use
 
influencer
 
marketing
 
to
 
reach
 
a
 
wider
 
audience
 
and
 
build
 
brand
 
awareness.
 
They
 
could
 
partner
 
with
 
key
 
influencers
 
in
 
the
 
audio
 
and
 
lifestyle
 
categories
 
to
 
promote
 
their
 
headphones.
What
 
Dyson
 
could
 
do
 
to
 
differentiate
 
its
 
headphones
 
from
 
Sennheiser:
●
Focus
 
on
 
active
 
noise
 
cancellation:
 
Dyson
 
is
 
known
 
for
 
its
 
expertise
 
in
 
air
 
purification
 
and
 
filtration.
 
They
 
could
 
use
 
this
 
expertise
 
to
 
develop
 
headphones
 
with
 
active
 
noise
 
cancellation
 
that
 
is
 
superior
 
to
 
Sennheiser's.
●
Emphasize
 
health
 
and
 
wellness:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
position
 
its
 
headphones
 
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
enhance
 
health
 
and
 
wellness.
 
They
 
could
 
highlight
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
their
 
headphones
 
filter
 
out
 
harmful
 
pollutants
 
and
 
improve
 
air
 
quality .
●
Target
 
a
 
specific
 
niche:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
target
 
a
 
specific
 
niche
 
of
 
the
 
headphone
 
market,
 
such
 
as
 
athletes
 
or
 
people
 
who
 
work
 
in
 
noisy
 
environments.
 
This
 
would
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
differentiate
 
their
 
product
 
and
 
appeal
 
to
 
a
 
more
 
targeted
 
audience.
In
 
addition
 
to
 
these
 
specific
 
recommendations,
 
Dyson
 
should
 
also
 
consider
 
the
 
following
 
general
 
marketing
 
strategies
 
when
 
launching
 
its
 
new
 
headphones:
●
Create
 
a
 
strong
 
brand
 
identity:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
develop
 
a
 
clear
 
and
 
consistent
 
brand
 
identity
 
for
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
includes
 
developing
 
a
 
memorable
 
logo,
 
tagline,
 
and
 
brand
 
messaging.
●
Target
 
the
 
right
 
audience:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
carefully
 
identify
 
its
 
target
 
audience
 
and
 
tailor
 
its
 
marketing
 
messages
 
to
 
that
 
audience.
 
This
 
includes
 
understanding
 
their
 
needs,
 
interests,
 
and
 
pain
 
points.
●
Create
 
compelling
 
marketing
 
materials:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
create
 
high-quality
 
marketing
 
materials
 
that
 
effectively
 
showcase
 
the
 
features
 
and
 
benefits
 
of
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
includes
 
print
 
ads,
 
video
 
ads,
 
and
 
social
 
media
 
content.
●
Launch
 
a
 
strong
 
public
 
relations
 
campaign:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
secure
 
positive
 
media
 
coverage
 
for
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
sending
 
out
 
press
 
releases,
 
pitching
 
stories
 
to
 
journalists,
 
and
 
attending
 
trade
 
shows
 
and
 
events.
●
Track
 
and
 
measure
 
results:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
track
 
and
 
measure
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
its
 
marketing
 
campaigns.
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
identify
 
what
 
is
 
working
 
well
 
and
 
what
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
improved.
By
 
implementing
 
these
 
strategies,
 
Dyson
 
can
 
effectively
 
differentiate
 
its
 
headphones
 
from
 
Sennheiser
 
and
 
achieve
 
success
 
in
 
the
 
market.

USP
 
for

more
 
retailers
 
and
 
expanding
 
their
 
online
 
store.
●
Develop
 
a
 
more
 
comprehensive
 
marketing
 
strategy:
 
HiFiMan's
 
marketing
 
strategy
 
could
 
be
 
more
 
comprehensive.
 
They
 
could
 
develop
 
a
 
multi-channel
 
approach
 
that
 
includes
 
social
 
media,
 
influencer
 
marketing,
 
and
 
public
 
relations.
What
 
Dyson
 
could
 
do
 
to
 
differentiate
 
its
 
headphones
 
from
 
HiFiMan:
●
Focus
 
on
 
active
 
noise
 
cancellation:
 
Dyson
 
is
 
known
 
for
 
its
 
expertise
 
in
 
air
 
purification
 
and
 
filtration.
 
They
 
could
 
use
 
this
 
expertise
 
to
 
develop
 
headphones
 
with
 
active
 
noise
 
cancellation
 
that
 
is
 
superior
 
to
 
HiFiMan's.
●
Emphasize
 
lifestyle
 
benefits:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
position
 
its
 
headphones
 
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
enhance
 
lifestyle
 
and
 
productivity .
 
They
 
could
 
highlight
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
their
 
headphones
 
offer
 
a
 
combination
 
of
 
great
 
sound
 
quality
 
and
 
air
 
filtration.
●
Target
 
a
 
wider
 
audience:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
target
 
a
 
wider
 
audience
 
than
 
HiFiMan,
 
including
 
not
 
only
 
audiophiles
 
but
 
also
 
casual
 
listeners
 
and
 
people
 
who
 
are
 
looking
 
for
 
a
 
more
 
versatile
 
product.
In
 
addition
 
to
 
these
 
specific
 
recommendations,
 
Dyson
 
should
 
also
 
consider
 
the
 
following
 
general
 
marketing
 
strategies
 
when
 
launching
 
its
 
new
 
headphones:
●
Create
 
a
 
strong
 
brand
 
identity:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
develop
 
a
 
clear
 
and
 
consistent
 
brand
 
identity
 
for
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
includes
 
developing
 
a
 
memorable
 
logo,
 
tagline,
 
and
 
brand
 
messaging.
●
Target
 
the
 
right
 
audience:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
carefully
 
identify
 
its
 
target
 
audience
 
and
 
tailor
 
its
 
marketing
 
messages
 
to
 
that
 
audience.
 
This
 
includes
 
understanding
 
their
 
needs,
 
interests,
 
and
 
pain
 
points.
●
Create
 
compelling
 
marketing
 
materials:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
create
 
high-quality
 
marketing
 
materials
 
that
 
effectively
 
showcase
 
the
 
features
 
and
 
benefits
 
of
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
includes
 
print
 
ads,
 
video
 
ads,
 
and
 
social
 
media
 
content.
●
Launch
 
a
 
strong
 
public
 
relations
 
campaign:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
secure
 
positive
 
media
 
coverage
 
for
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
sending
 
out
 
press
 
releases,
 
pitching
 
stories
 
to
 
journalists,
 
and
 
attending
 
trade
 
shows
 
and
 
events.
●
Track
 
and
 
measure
 
results:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
track
 
and
 
measure
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
its
 
marketing
 
campaigns.
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
identify
 
what
 
is
 
working
 
well
 
and
 
what
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
improved.

What
 
JBL
 
is
 
doing
 
well:
●
Strong
 
brand
 
presence:
 
JBL
 
has
 
a
 
strong
 
brand
 
presence
 
across
 
social
 
media,
 
with
 
millions
 
of
 
followers
 
on
 
Facebook,

and

This
 
helps
 
them
 
to
 
reach
 
a
 
wide
 
audience
 
and
 
promote
 
their
 
products
 
effectively .
●
Effective
 
influencer
 
marketing:
 
JBL
 
partners
 
with
 
key
 
influencers
 
in
 
the
 
music
 
and
 
lifestyle
 
categories
 
to
 
promote
 
their

This
 
helps
 
them
 
to
 
reach
 
a
 
younger
 
audience
 
and
 
build
 
brand
 
awareness.
●
Targeted
 
marketing:
 
JBL
 
uses
 
data-driven
 
marketing
 
to
 
target
 
its
 
ads
 
to
 
specific
 
audiences
 
based
 
on

behavior .
 
This
 
helps
 
them
 
to
 
reach
 
the
 
right
 
people
 
with
 
the
 
right
 
messages.
What
 
JBL
 
could
 
do
 
better:
●
Highlight
 
sound
 
quality:
 
JBL's
 
focus
 
on
 
affordability
 
sometimes
 
overshadows
 
their
 
commitment
 
to
 
sound
 
quality .
 
They
 
could
 
do
 
a
 
better
 
job
 
of
 
emphasizing
 
the
 
high-quality
 
audio
 
experience
 
that
 
their
 
headphones
 
offer.
●
Expand
 
into
 
premium
 
segment:
 
JBL's
 
core
 
market
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
mid-range
 
and
 
budget
 
segments.
 
They
 
could
 
expand
 
into
 
the
 
premium
 
segment
 
by
 
offering
 
higher-end
 
headphones
 
with
 
more
 
advanced
 
features.
●
Strengthen
 
loyalty
 
program:
 
JBL
 
offers
 
a
 
loyalty
 
program,
 
but
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
as
 
comprehensive
 
or
 
rewards-rich
 
as
 
some
 
of
 
its
 
competitors.
 
They
 
could
 
improve
 
their
 
loyalty
 
program
 
to
 
better
 
retain
 
customers
 
and
 
encourage
 
repeat
 
purchases.
What
 
Dyson
 
could
 
do
 
to
 
differentiate
 
its
 
headphones
 
from
 
JBL:
●
Focus
 
on
 
air
 
purification
 
technology:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
leverage
 
its
 
expertise
 
in
 
air
 
purification
 
to
 
develop
 
headphones
 
with
 
advanced
 
air
 
filtration
 
systems.
 
This
 
would
 
set
 
their
 
headphones
 
apart
 
from
 
JBL's
 
offerings
 
and
 
appeal
 
to
 
health-conscious
 
consumers.
●
Target
 
professionals:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
target
 
professionals
 
who
 
work
 
in
 
noisy
 
environments,
 
such
 
as
 
office
 
workers
 
or
 
construction
 
workers.
 
They
 
could
 
emphasize
 
the
 
headphones'
 
ability
 
to
 
block
 
out
 
distractions
 
and
 
improve
 
focus.
●
Position
 
as
 
a
 
lifestyle
 
accessory:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
position
 
its
 
headphones
 
as
 
a
 
stylish
 
and
 
aspirational
 
accessory .
 
They
 
could
 
collaborate
 
with
 
designers
 
and
 
fashion
 
brands
 
to
 
create
 
limited-edition
 
headphones
 
that
 
would
 
appeal
 
to
 
a
 
more
 
fashion-conscious
 
audience.
In
 
addition
 
to
 
these
 
specific
 
recommendations,
 
Dyson
 
should
 
also
 
consider
 
the
 
following
 
general
 
marketing
 
strategies
 
when
 
launching
 
its
 
new
 
headphones:
●
Emphasize
 
the
 
unique
 
benefits
 
of
 
air
 
purification:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
clearly
 
communicate
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
having
 
air
 
purification
 
integrated
 
into
 
headphones.
 
They
 
could
 
highlight
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
their
 
headphones
 
can
 
remove
 
harmful
 
pollutants
 
from
 
the
 
air
 
and
 
improve
 
overall
 
health
 
and
 
well-being.
●
Target
 
a
 
wide
 
audience:
 
Dyson's
 
headphones
 
could
 
appeal
 
to
 
a
 
broad
 
range
 
of
 
consumers,
 
from
 
health-conscious
 
individuals
 
to
 
professionals
 
who
 
need
 
noise
 
cancellation.
 
They
 
should
 
create
 
marketing
 
messages
 
that
 
resonate
 
with
 
different
 
customer
 
segments.
●
Create
 
interactive
 
experiences:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
create
 
interactive
 
experiences
 
for
 
potential
 
customers
 
to
 
try
 
out
 
their
 
headphones.
 
This
 
could
 
involve
 
pop-up
 
shops,
 
product
 
demonstrations,
 
or
 
virtual
 
reality
 
experiences.

of
 
using

This

has
 
been
 
very
 
successful
 
in
 
building

and
 
driving

What
 
Beats
 
could
 
do
 
better:
●
Address
 
criticism
 
of
 
sound
 
quality:
 
Some
 
critics
 
have
 
argued
 
that
 
Beats
 
headphones
 
have
 
exaggerated
 
bass
 
and
 
are
 
not
 
as
 
well-suited
 
for
 
critical
 
listening
 
as
 
other

Beats
 
could
 
address
 
this
 
criticism
 
by
 
emphasizing
 
the
 
other
 
benefits
 
of
 
its
 
headphones,
 
such
 
as
 
their
 
stylish
 
design
 
and
 
comfortable

●
Expand
 
into
 
new
 
markets:
 
Beats
 
is
 
currently
 
a
 
dominant
 
player
 
in
 
the
 
mainstream
 
headphone
 
market.
 
However ,
 
the
 
company
 
could
 
expand
 
its
 
reach
 
by
 
exploring
 
new
 
markets,
 
such
 
as
 
the
 
high-end
 
audiophile
 
market
 
or
 
the
 
professional
 
audio
 
market.
●
Develop
 
innovative
 
new
 
products:
 
The
 
headphone
 
market
 
is
 
becoming
 
increasingly
 
competitive.
 
Beats
 
could
 
stay
 
ahead
 
of
 
the
 
competition
 
by
 
developing
 
new
 
and
 
innovative
 
products,
 
such
 
as
 
headphones
 
with
 
integrated
 
fitness
 
tracking
 
or
 
headphones
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
control
 
smart
 
home
 
devices.
What
 
Dyson
 
could
 
do
 
to
 
differentiate
 
its
 
headphones
 
from
 
Beats:
●
Focus
 
on
 
air
 
filtration:
 
Dyson
 
is
 
known
 
for
 
its
 
expertise
 
in
 
air
 
purification
 
and
 
filtration.
 
They
 
could
 
use
 
this
 
expertise
 
to
 
develop
 
headphones
 
with
 
active
 
noise
 
cancellation
 
and
 
air
 
filtration
 
capabilities.
●
Emphasize
 
health
 
and
 
wellness:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
position
 
its
 
headphones
 
as
 
a
 
way
 
to
 
enhance
 
health
 
and
 
wellness.
 
They
 
could
 
highlight
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
their
 
headphones
 
filter
 
out
 
harmful
 
pollutants
 
and
 
improve
 
air
 
quality .
●
Target
 
a
 
specific
 
niche:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
target
 
a
 
specific
 
niche
 
of
 
the
 
headphone
 
market,
 
such
 
as
 
athletes
 
or
 
people
 
who
 
work
 
in
 
noisy
 
environments.
 
This
 
would
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
differentiate
 
their
 
product
 
and
 
appeal
 
to
 
a
 
more
 
targeted
 
audience.
In
 
addition
 
to
 
these
 
specific
 
recommendations,
 
Dyson
 
should
 
also
 
consider
 
the
 
following
 
general
 
marketing
 
strategies
 
when
 
launching
 
its

headphones:
●
Emphasize
 
the
 
unique
 
benefits
 
of
 
its
 
air
 
filtration
 
technology:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
focus
 
on
 
how
 
its
 
headphones
 
can
 
provide
 
a
 
unique
 
and
 
valuable
 
experience
 
to
 
customers.
 
This
 
could
 
include
 
highlighting
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
the
 
headphones
 
can
 
filter
 
out
 
harmful
 
pollutants,
 
improve
 
air
 
quality ,
 
and
 
help
 
to
 
reduce
 
noise
 
pollution.
●
Position
 
its
 
headphones
 
as
 
a
 
lifestyle
 
product:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
position
 
its
 
headphones
 
as
 
a
 
part
 
of
 
a
 
broader
 
lifestyle
 
brand.
 
This
 
could
 
include
 
partnering
 
with
 
other
 
brands
 
in
 
the
 
health
 
and
 
wellness
 
space,
 
such
 
as
 
fitness
 
trackers
 
or
 
sleep
 
masks.
●
Target
 
a
 
global
 
audience:
 
Dyson
 
has
 
a
 
strong
 
reputation
 
in
 
Asia
 
and
 
Europe.
 
The
 
company
 
should
 
leverage
 
this
 
reputation
 
by
 
targeting
 
these
 
markets
 
early
 
on
 
in
 
the
 
launch
 
of
 
its
 
new
 
headphones.

What
 
Jabra
 
is
 
doing
 
well:
●
Focus
 
on
 
business
 
users:
 
Jabra
 
has
 
a
 
strong
 
reputation
 
for
 
providing
 
high-quality
 
headphones
 
for
 
business
 
users.
 
They
 
understand
 
the
 
needs
 
of
 
this
 
segment
 
and
 
cater
 
to
 
them
 
with
 
features
 
like
 
advanced
 
noise
 
cancellation
 
and
 
crystal-clear
 
call

●
Strong
 
social
 
media
 
presence:
 
Jabra
 
has
 
a
 
large
 
and
 
engaged
 
social
 
media
 
following.
 
They
 
use
 
these
 
platforms
 
to
 
connect
 
with
 
their
 
target
 
audience,
 
share
 
news
 
and
 
updates,
 
and
 
promote
 
their
 
products.
●
Effective
 
influencer
 
marketing:
 
Jabra
 
partners
 
with
 
key
 
influencers
 
in
 
the
 
audio
 
and
 
lifestyle
 
categories
 
to
 
promote
 
their
 
headphones.
 
This
 
helps
 
them
 
reach
 
a
 
wider
 
audience
 
and
 
build
 
brand
 
awareness.
What
 
Jabra
 
could
 
do
 
better:
●
Expand
 
into
 
consumer
 
markets:
 
While
 
Jabra
 
is
 
known
 
for
 
its
 
business
 
headphones,
 
they
 
could
 
also
 
benefit
 
from
 
expanding
 
into
 
the
 
consumer
 
market.
 
This
 
would
 
allow
 
them
 
to
 
reach
 
a
 
broader
 
audience
 
and
 
grow
 
their
 
brand.
●
Focus
 
on
 
innovation:
 
Jabra
 
should
 
continue
 
to
 
innovate
 
and
 
develop
 
new
 
features
 
and
 
technologies
 
for
 
their
 
headphones.
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
them
 
stay
 
ahead
 
of
 
the
 
competition
 
and
 
maintain
 
their
 
competitive
 
edge.
What
 
Dyson
 
could
 
do
 
to
 
differentiate
 
its
 
headphones
 
from
 
Jabra:
●
Emphasize
 
the
 
air
 
purification
 
aspect:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
highlight
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
their
 
headphones
 
filter
 
out
 
harmful
 
pollutants
 
and
 
improve
 
air
 
quality .
 
This
 
would
 
be
 
a
 
unique
 
selling
 
point
 
that
 
sets
 
them
 
apart
 
from
 
Jabra
 
and
 
other
 
headphones
 
brands.
●
Target
 
a
 
younger
 
audience:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
target
 
a
 
younger
 
audience
 
that
 
is
 
more
 
interested
 
in
 
health
 
and
 
wellness.
 
This
 
would
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
differentiate
 
their
 
product
 
and
 
appeal
 
to
 
a
 
new
 
demographic.
●
Create
 
a
 
more
 
premium
 
brand
 
experience:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
focus
 
on
 
creating
 
a
 
more
 
premium
 
brand
 
experience
 
for
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
could
 
include
 
using
 
high-quality
 
materials,
 
offering
 
exceptional
 
customer
 
service,
 
and
 
creating
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
exclusivity .
In
 
addition
 
to
 
these
 
specific
 
recommendations,
 
Dyson
 
should
 
also
 
consider
 
the
 
following
 
general
 
marketing
 
strategies
 
when
 
launching
 
its
 
new
 
headphones:
●
Partner
 
with
 
health
 
and
 
wellness
 
influencers:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
partner
 
with
 
health
 
and
 
wellness
 
influencers
 
to
 
promote
 
their
 
headphones.
 
These
 
influencers
 
could
 
help
 
to
 
reach
 
a
 
younger
 
audience
 
and
 
showcase
 
the
 
health
 
benefits
 
of
 
the
 
product.
●
Create
 
educational
 
content:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
create
 
educational
 
content
 
about
 
the
 
importance
 
of
 
air
 
quality
 
and
 
the
 
benefits
 
of
 
noise
 
cancellation.
 
This
 
content
 
could
 
be
 
shared
 
on
 
social
 
media,
 
the
 
company
 
website,
 
and
 
other
 
channels.
●
Offer
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
accessories:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
offer
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
accessories
 
for
 
its
 
headphones,
 
such
 
as
 
carrying
 
cases,
 
cleaning
 
kits,
 
and
 
replacement
 
filters.
 
This
 
would
 
provide
 
additional
 
value
 
to
 
customers
 
and
 
encourage
 
repeat
 
purchases.

Proposition
 
(USP):

Affordable
 
pricing:
 
Anker's
 
headphones
 
are
 
typically
 
priced
 
much
 
lower
 
than
 
those
 
of
 
other
 
major
 
brands.
●
High

Anker
 
is
 
known
 
for
 
producing
 
high-quality

that
 
are
 
built

offers
 
a
 
wide

of

What
 
Anker
 
is
 
doing
 
well:
●
Targeted
 
marketing:
 
Anker
 
uses
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
marketing
 
channels
 
to
 
reach
 
their
 
target
 
audience,
 
including
 
social
 
media,
 
influencer
 
marketing,
 
and
 
paid
 
advertising.
 
They
 
are
 
particularly
 
effective
 
at
 
targeting
 
millennials
 
and
 
Gen
 
Z
 
consumers.
●
Strong
 
brand
 
image:
 
Anker
 
has
 
a
 
strong
 
brand
 
image
 
that
 
is
 
based
 
on
 
value,
 
quality ,
 
and
 
innovation.
 
This
 
image
 
has
 
helped
 
them
 
to
 
build
 
a
 
loyal
 
customer
 
base.
●
Effective
 
pricing:
 
Anker's
 
pricing
 
strategy
 
is
 
a
 
key
 
factor
 
in
 
their
 
success.
 
They
 
offer
 
high-quality
 
products
 
at
 
very
 
affordable
 
prices,
 
which
 
makes
 
them
 
an
 
attractive
 
option
 
for
 
many
 
consumers.
What
 
Anker
 
could
 
do
 
better:
●
Emphasize
 
innovation:
 
Anker
 
could
 
do
 
a
 
better
 
job
 
of
 
emphasizing
 
their
 
commitment
 
to
 
innovation.
 
They
 
have
 
a
 
history
 
of
 
developing
 
new
 
and
 
innovative
 
products,
 
but
 
they
 
don't
 
always
 
communicate
 
this
 
effectively
 
to
 
their
 
customers.
●
Expand
 
into
 
new
 
markets:
 
Anker
 
could
 
expand
 
into
 
new
 
markets
 
by
 
developing
 
headphones
 
that
 
are
 
targeted
 
to
 
specific
 
demographics
 
or
 
niches.
 
For
 
example,
 
they
 
could
 
develop
 
a
 
line
 
of
 
headphones
 
for
 
athletes
 
or
 
for
 
people
 
who
 
work
 
in
 
noisy
 
environments.
●
Partner
 
with
 
influencers:
 
Anker
 
could
 
partner
 
with
 
more
 
influencers
 
to
 
promote
 
their
 
headphones.
 
This
 
could
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
reach
 
a
 
wider
 
audience
 
and
 
build
 
brand
 
awareness.
What
 
Dyson
 
could
 
do
 
to
 
differentiate
 
its
 
headphones
 
from
 
Anker:
●
Focus
 
on
 
the
 
air
 
purification
 
feature:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
emphasize
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
their
 
headphones
 
are
 
the
 
only
 
ones
 
on
 
the
 
market
 
that
 
filter
 
out
 
harmful
 
pollutants.
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
a
 
major
 
selling
 
point
 
for
 
consumers
 
who
 
are
 
concerned
 
about
 
their
 
health
 
and
 
well-being.
●
Position
 
the
 
headphones
 
as
 
a
 
luxury
 
product:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
position
 
its
 
headphones
 
as
 
a
 
premium
 
product
 
that
 
is
 
worth
 
the
 
extra
 
money .
 
They
 
could
 
focus
 
on
 
the
 
quality
 
of
 
the
 
materials,
 
the
 
design,
 
and
 
the
 
features.
●
Target
 
a
 
more
 
affluent
 
audience:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
target
 
a
 
more
 
affluent
 
audience
 
than
 
Anker .
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
advertising
 
in
 
upscale
 
publications
 
and
 
partnering
 
with
 
luxury
 
brands.
In
 
addition
 
to
 
these
 
specific
 
recommendations,
 
Dyson
 
should
 
also
 
consider
 
the
 
following
 
general
 
marketing
 
strategies
 
when
 
launching
 
its
 
new
 
headphones:
●
Highlight
 
the
 
unique
 
selling
 
proposition:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
clearly
 
communicate
 
the
 
unique
 
selling
 
proposition
 
of
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
means
 
emphasizing
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
they
 
are
 
the
 
only
 
headphones
 
on
 
the
 
market
 
with
 
built-in
 
air
 
purifiers.
●
Use
 
strong
 
visuals:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
use
 
strong
 
visuals
 
in
 
its
 
marketing
 
materials.
 
This
 
means
 
using
 
high-quality
 
photos
 
and
 
videos
 
that
 
showcase
 
the
 
design
 
and
 
features
 
of
 
the
 
headphones.
●
Create
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
urgency:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
create
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
urgency
 
in
 
its
 
marketing
 
campaigns.
 
This
 
can
 
be
 
done
 
by
 
offering
 
limited-time
 
discounts
 
or
 
by
 
running
 
contests
 
and
 
giveaways.
●
Track
 
and
 
measure
 
results:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
track
 
and
 
measure
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
its
 
marketing
 
campaigns.
 
This
 
will
 
help
 
them
 
to
 
identify
 
what
 
is
 
working
 
well
 
and
 
what
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
improved.

to
 
develop

purify

health
 
and
 
wellness
 
by
 
improving
 
air
 
quality .
 
They
 
could
 
highlight
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
their
 
headphones
 
filter
 
out
 
harmful
 
pollutants
 
and
 
improve
 
overall
 
well-being.
●
Create
 
a
 
sense
 
of
 
innovation:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
focus
 
on
 
developing
 
innovative
 
features
 
and
 
technologies
 
that
 
set
 
its
 
headphones
 
apart
 
from
 
Bowers
 
&
 
Wilkins
 
and
 
other
 
brands.
 
This
 
could
 
include
 
features
 
such
 
as
 
adaptive
 
noise
 
cancellation,
 
personalized
 
sound
 
profiles,
 
and
 
haptic
 
feedback.
In
 
addition
 
to
 
these
 
specific
 
recommendations,
 
Dyson
 
should
 
also
 
consider
 
the
 
following
 
general
 
marketing
 
strategies
 
when
 
launching
 
its
 
new
 
headphones:
●
Create
 
a
 
compelling
 
narrative:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
create
 
a
 
compelling
 
story
 
that
 
connects
 
with
 
its
 
target
 
audience
 
and
 
highlights
 
the
 
unique
 
benefits
 
of
 
its
 
headphones.
 
This
 
narrative
 
should
 
be
 
consistent
 
across
 
all
 
marketing
 
channels.
●
Leverage
 
experiential
 
marketing:
 
Dyson
 
could
 
create
 
immersive
 
experiences
 
that
 
allow
 
potential
 
customers
 
to
 
try
 
out
 
its
 
headphones
 
and
 
experience
 
the
 
benefits
 
for
 
themselves.
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
done
 
through
 
pop-up
 
events,
 
product
 
demos,
 
and
 
partnerships
 
with
 
retail
 
stores.
●
Build
 
brand
 
advocacy:
 
Dyson
 
should
 
encourage
 
its
 
customers
 
to
 
become
 
brand
 
advocates
 
by
 
sharing
 
their
 
positive
 
experiences
 
on
 
social
 
media
 
and
 
other
 
platforms.
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
done
 
through
 
social
 
media
 
contests,
 
referral
 
programs,
 
and
 
loyalty
 
rewards.

Speaker
 
Notes:
Effective
 
messaging
 
goes
 
beyond
 
just
 
listing
 
features.
 
We
 
must
 
focus
 
on
 
what
 
makes
 
the
 
Dyson
 
Zone™
 
truly
 
unique
 
and
 
innovative.
 
By
 
emphasizing
 
its
 
health
 
benefits,
 
aspirational
 
design,
 
and
 
unparalleled
 
functionality ,
 
we
 
can
 
differentiate
 
ourselves
 
from
 
competitors
 
and
 
attract
 
a
 
wider
 
audience
 
seeking
 
a
 
bold
 
and
 
impactful
 
product.
Remember:
Adapt
 
these
 
slides

of
 
potential
 
partners
 
and
 
messaging
 
strategies
 
relevant
 
to
 
your

the
 
most
 
impactful
 
partnerships
 
and
 
messaging
 
approaches.
