- 🐜 If you cook or handle food, remember to always wipe the worktops with a sponge please 🙏🏽🙏🏽, ants proliferate quickly in the tropics.🌴
-🍽️🔪🥘 As there are sometimes many of us using the kitchen, please wash, dry and put away the dishes you use immediately after use. We avoid letting the dishes dry for the next users. Thank you very much for your contribution 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽❤️❤️❤️
- 🐜🐜Same on the tables after meals please, trays etc. Even if it's clean, a wipe with a sponge is always welcome. The 🐜 have already devoured some recalcitrants....😎
-🗑️ If you see that the trash cans are full, please do not overload them. The containers are near the entrance gate and the bags under the sink.👍👍
-👙 In shared spaces, remember not to leave your things lying around because we often host professional events and some work there during the day.
- 🧺You can use the washing machines, remember to get some detergent please.
-🪬🧖♨️🪻 For the spa, sauna and jacuzzi, you can download the user guides via the QR codes in the frames in your room.
That may be a bit long, but everything is normally there so that you can be independent!
