HOW TO USE
THE SHOWER HEAD?
STEP 1 Locate the shower head.

STEP 2 Place the sprayer under the buttocks, aiming at the area you want to clean.
Lightly press the trigger to start spraying.

Tip: You can use your hand to help you clean the desired area.

STEP 3: Pass the shower head either from the back of the seat or from the front, depending on your mobility and comfort.

STEP 4: After making sure you are clean, simply dry yourself with toilet paper or a towel. Throw the paper in the toilet.

And why...?

Clean:
Using the toilet shower head is much more hygienic than traditional toilet paper. Toilet paper to wipe yourself...no it's not
clean. A toilet shower head therefore allows for quality cleaning and reduces the spread of germs.
Gentle:
People with sensitive skin will find it more comfortable.
A splash of cool water can help soothe skin irritations and
reduce the risk of irritation.

Eco-friendly:
You only need a few sheets to dry yourself. One of the main benefits of a toilet spray is the reduction in toilet paper usage. It is estimated that people waste around 17 million trees each year because of toilet paper.
In Asian countries, where water has always been of particular importance in culture, people have understood this and have adopted this equipment in large numbers. As a result, they can be found almost everywhere: in public and private places.
